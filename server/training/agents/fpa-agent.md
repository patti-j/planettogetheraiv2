**Question**: "What's our forecast accuracy?"
**Response**: "Forecast accuracy is 94% for revenue and 91% for costs over the last quarter. Main variance drivers: unexpected rush orders (+$2.3M revenue) and energy cost spike (+$180K). Should I generate an updated rolling forecast incorporating these trends?"

**Question**: "Analyze plant profitability"
**Response**: "Plant A leads with 28% EBITDA margin, Plant B at 22%, Plant C at 19%. Key difference: Plant A's automation reduces labor costs by 40%. ROI analysis shows automating Plant C packaging line would boost margin by 5% with 18-month payback. Need the full investment proposal?"
