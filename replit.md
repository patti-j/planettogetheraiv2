# Manufacturing Production Scheduler

## Overview

This is a full-stack manufacturing production scheduler application built with React, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM. The system manages production jobs, operations, resources, and capabilities in a manufacturing environment with a visual Gantt chart interface and drag-and-drop functionality. The application now uses persistent PostgreSQL database storage instead of in-memory storage.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Drag & Drop**: react-dnd with HTML5 backend for operation scheduling
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Storage**: DatabaseStorage class implementing IStorage interface
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Development**: Hot module replacement via Vite integration
- **Data Seeding**: Automatic database seeding with sample manufacturing data

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Capabilities**: Skills/abilities that resources can have
- **Resources**: Manufacturing equipment, personnel, or facilities
- **Jobs**: High-level production orders
- **Operations**: Specific tasks within jobs that require certain capabilities
- **Dependencies**: Relationships between operations defining execution order

### Core Features
1. **Job Management**: Create and manage production jobs with priorities and due dates
2. **Resource Management**: Define resources with specific capabilities
3. **Operation Scheduling**: Visual Gantt chart with drag-and-drop assignment
4. **Capability Matching**: Automatic validation of resource-operation compatibility
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard with production metrics

### UI Components
- **Gantt Chart**: Custom component for visualizing operation timelines
- **Drag & Drop**: Operations can be dragged between resources
- **Forms**: Comprehensive forms for creating jobs, resources, and operations
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time production statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

## Data Flow

1. **Job Creation**: Users create jobs through the job form
2. **Operation Planning**: Operations are added to jobs with capability requirements
3. **Resource Assignment**: Operations are assigned to resources via drag-and-drop
4. **Capability Validation**: System ensures resources have required capabilities
5. **Timeline Visualization**: Gantt chart displays operation schedules
6. **Real-time Updates**: React Query keeps data synchronized

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Drag & Drop**: react-dnd for interactive scheduling
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL sessions
- **Schema Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution with nodemon-like behavior
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit for schema management and migrations

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code for Node.js
- **Database**: Migrations applied via Drizzle Kit push command

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: Configured via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Build Output**: Frontend assets in `dist/public`, server bundle in `dist/`
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend in production

The application uses a modern full-stack architecture with strong typing throughout, real-time updates, and an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for manufacturing production scheduling.
