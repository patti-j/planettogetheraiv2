# PlanetTogether - Manufacturing SCM + APS System

## Overview
PlanetTogether is an AI-first Factory Optimization Platform, a full-stack manufacturing SCM + APS system. Its core purpose is to leverage AI for optimized production planning, dynamic resource allocation, and intelligent dashboarding, providing complete supply chain visibility through a visual Gantt chart interface. The system is designed for enterprise-grade production deployment in pharmaceutical, chemical, and industrial manufacturing, emphasizing real-time optimization, data integrity, and comprehensive reporting. Key capabilities include multi-agent support, modular federation, and advanced AI integration for scheduling and system intelligence, aiming to improve business vision and market potential.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

Multiple users working on project:
- JC = Jim
- PJ = Patti

**AI Branding Standard**: Always use Sparkles icon for AI-related features and branding. Never use Brain or other icons for AI functionality.

Note on concurrent work:
- Jim and Patti work on different issues concurrently
- Each conversation/thread is independent - I don't retain context between different sessions
- Best practice: Start each request with your name/initials for clarity
- If continuing previous work, briefly mention what was done before

## System Architecture

### Design Principles & Guidelines
The system prioritizes user experience, data integrity, performance, accessibility, and consistency, with a focus on quality assurance.

### Frontend Architecture
-   **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
-   **UI Framework**: Shadcn/UI built on Radix UI primitives.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables.
-   **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state.
-   **Routing**: Wouter.
-   **Drag & Drop**: react-dnd.
-   **Gantt Chart**: Bryntum Scheduler Pro for production scheduling visualization.
-   **UI/UX Decisions**: Consistent color schemes, professional modal designs, responsive layouts, standardized button styling, intuitive navigation, integrated workflow for dashboard and widget creation, Excel-like cell editing, user-configurable layouts with persistence, and centralized layout density controls.

### Backend Architecture
-   **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
-   **Storage**: DatabaseStorage class implementing IStorage interface.
-   **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses, role-based authentication.
-   **Authentication System**: Unified role-based permissions system with JWT authentication.
-   **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for NLP, intelligent data generation, custom metric calculation, AI-powered modifications, and dynamic content creation.
-   **Hint System Service**: Intelligent contextual hints with user interaction tracking.

### Core System Design & Features
-   **Navigation**: Unified layout system with consistent header/navigation for desktop and footer bar for mobile.
-   **Data Model**: Comprehensive database schema, including SAP-compliant production version architecture and migration to integer foreign keys. Exclusively uses PT (PlanetTogether) tables for manufacturing data.
-   **Inventory Management**: Stock-centric system tracking specific records.
-   **Master Data Management**: Unified interface with AI-powered modification and validation.
-   **Production Scheduling**: Visual Gantt chart, operation sequencer, scheduling algorithms (ASAP, ALAP, Critical Path, Resource Leveling, Theory of Constraints/DBR, PERT) using Bryntum's constraint engine, and PT Resource Capabilities System. Features include auto zoom-to-fit, a comprehensive auto-save system for manual changes (drag/drop, resize, edit) with `manually_scheduled` flag preservation, and calendar management for working hours and maintenance. Bryntum native theme switching is supported.
-   **Optimization Studio Integration**: Centralized algorithm management through dynamic loading and mapping to client-side Bryntum-based implementations, supporting server-side execution path for approved algorithms.
-   **Demand Forecasting**: Native React application with SQL Server integration for dynamic table/column selection, date/quantity auto-detection, item-level filtering, and time-series forecasting visualization using Recharts.
-   **Dynamic Paginated Reports**: Dedicated page for viewing data from any SQL Server table with pagination, filtering, sorting, and search capabilities, featuring secure schema validation and schema caching.
-   **Dashboarding & Analytics**: UI Design Studio for custom visualizations, AI-powered dashboard generation, and a drag-and-drop designer with widget library and professional templates.
-   **Role-Based Access Control**: Unified permission system with feature-action permissions.
-   **User Experience**: Session persistence for UI preferences, intelligent auto-fit, filter-specific layout persistence, and comprehensive error handling.
-   **Communication & Collaboration**: Integrated chat, feedback system, and email notifications. Max AI service provides real-time production intelligence, status monitoring, schedule analysis, bottleneck detection, resource conflict detection, and optimization recommendations.
-   **AI Alert System**: Configurable AI analysis triggers with OpenAI GPT-4o integration.
-   **AI Agents Control Panel**: Centralized management interface for all AI agents.
-   **Global Control Tower**: Enhanced with KPI target management, weighted performance tracking, autonomous optimization, and real-time plant monitoring.
-   **Production Scheduler Architecture**: Uses a hybrid iframe/React architecture where a React wrapper component loads a standalone HTML file containing the Bryntum Scheduler Pro via a backend API route.
-   **Voice Chat**: Integrates real-time voice chat with OpenAI's gpt-realtime-mini model, featuring WebSocket architecture, SSE for audio/transcript streaming, and automatic pause detection.
