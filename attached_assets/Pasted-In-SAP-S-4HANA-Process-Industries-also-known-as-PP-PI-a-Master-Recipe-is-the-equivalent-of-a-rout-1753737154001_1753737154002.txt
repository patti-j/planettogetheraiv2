In SAP S/4HANA Process Industries (also known as PP-PI), a Master Recipe is the equivalent of a routing in discrete manufacturing but tailored for process manufacturing (like chemicals, food, pharma). It defines how a product is made, and its structure captures the steps, resources, and relationships involved.

🧬 Structure of a Master Recipe

A Master Recipe is organized in a hierarchical structure, composed of the following key elements:

1. Header (Recipe Header)
	•	Material: Finished or intermediate product the recipe is for.
	•	Plant
	•	Validity Dates: From/to dates when the recipe is valid.
	•	Status: (e.g., Created, Released for Planning, Released for Execution)
	•	Base Quantity: Standard quantity the recipe is designed for.

✅ Think of this as the “container” that holds all the instructions.

⸻

2. Operations
	•	Define individual processing steps (e.g., mixing, heating, filling).
	•	Each operation includes:
	•	Operation Number
	•	Work Center (equipment or production line)
	•	Control Key (defines scheduling, costing, confirmation)
	•	Standard values (e.g., duration, setup time, processing time)
	•	Resources: Human, machine, utility requirements

⸻

3. Phases (PP-PI Specific)
	•	Subdivisions of operations; allow more granularity.
	•	Each phase can have:
	•	Resource assignment (e.g., specific vessel or machine)
	•	Standard values (execution times, cost factors)
	•	Input/Output parameters
	•	Linked to process instructions (used in PI sheets or control recipes)

🔁 You can think of phases as detailed steps within an operation.

⸻

4. Materials (Component Allocation)
	•	Materials (from the BOM) are assigned to specific phases.
	•	Tells SAP which raw materials are used in which process step.
	•	This drives:
	•	Shop floor instructions
	•	Material staging
	•	Batch tracing

⸻

5. Relationships
	•	Define the sequence and dependency between operations/phases.
	•	Can be:
	•	Finish-Start (FS): Common, next step starts after previous finishes
	•	Start-Start (SS), Finish-Finish (FF), etc.
	•	These relationships help schedule the process correctly.

⸻

6. Process Instructions (Optional)
	•	Used for integration with Process Control Systems (PCS).
	•	Allow communication of instructions (e.g., temperature, stirring speed) via PI sheets or XSteps.
	•	Essential for batch-oriented industries and compliance.

🧱 Visual Summary of Recipe Structure

Master Recipe (Header)
├── Operation 0010
│   ├── Phase A (Mixing)
│   │   └── Material: Water, Sugar
│   └── Phase B (Heating)
│       └── Material: Flavor
├── Operation 0020
│   └── Phase A (Filling)
│       └── Material: Packaging
└── Relationships (0010 before 0020, etc.)

🧾 Practical Use in PP-PI
	•	Batch Scheduling: Recipe steps determine the order and duration.
	•	Costing: Resources and durations flow into standard and actual cost.
	•	Compliance: Critical for FDA/GMP-regulated environments.
	•	Automation Integration: Phases linked to DCS/PLC systems via process messages.

✅ Key Takeaways
	•	A recipe defines how to produce a material in process industries.
	•	It includes operations, phases, resources, material assignments, and instructions.
	•	Recipes are more flexible and detailed than routings to support continuous and batch processes.
