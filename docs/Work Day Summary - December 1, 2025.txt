WHAT I WORKED ON TODAY

Onboarding Wizard Overhaul
Changed industry selection from single-select dropdown to multi-select checkboxes
Allows companies operating across multiple sectors to select all relevant industries
Selected industries display with blue highlight and checkmark visual feedback
Benefits/ROI projections now combine data from all selected industries

Streamlined Onboarding Flow
Reduced from 5 steps to 4 steps: Company Info → Benefits → Goals → Continue
Removed plants setup section entirely from onboarding wizard
Plant configuration will be handled separately in Implementation Hub
Updated step indicators and navigation to reflect new 4-step flow

UX Improvements
Removed seconds from Max AI timestamps for cleaner display
Replaced 3-dot dropdown menu with direct X button for delete in Uploaded Requirements
Provides cleaner UX since the menu only had a single delete action

Navigation Reorganization
Moved "Manufacturing Requirements" from "Training & Support" to "Management & Administration"
Now located under "Implementation Projects" for better workflow alignment
Improves logical grouping with related implementation tracking features

Bug Fixes
Fixed TypeScript errors related to companyInfo.industry → companyInfo.industries migration
Updated plant lookup API calls to use industries array joined with commas
Fixed completion summary to display all selected industries properly
FIXED: Date conversion error in business goals creation - backend now properly converts ISO string dates to Date objects before database insertion

Sample Data Population
Created seed endpoint for customer requirements (/api/customer-requirements/seed)
Seeded 10 sample requirements across 5 customers (Acme Manufacturing, Precision Parts Inc, Global Foods Corp, PharmaCo Industries, AutoTech Components)
Requirements span various lifecycle statuses: uploaded, modeling_pending, modeling_in_progress, modeling_complete, testing_pending, testing_in_progress, deployment_pending, deployed
Covers multiple industry segments: Discrete Manufacturing, Precision Manufacturing, Food & Beverage, Pharmaceutical, Automotive
