WHAT I WORKED ON TODAY

Onboarding Wizard Overhaul
Changed industry selection from single-select dropdown to multi-select checkboxes
Allows companies operating across multiple sectors to select all relevant industries
Selected industries display with blue highlight and checkmark visual feedback
Benefits/ROI projections now combine data from all selected industries

Streamlined Onboarding Flow
Reduced from 5 steps to 4 steps: Company Info → Benefits → Goals → Continue
Removed plants setup section entirely from onboarding wizard
Plant configuration will be handled separately in Implementation Hub
Updated step indicators and navigation to reflect new 4-step flow

UX Improvements
Removed seconds from Max AI timestamps for cleaner display
Replaced 3-dot dropdown menu with direct X button for delete in Uploaded Requirements
Provides cleaner UX since the menu only had a single delete action

Navigation Reorganization
Moved "Manufacturing Requirements" from "Training & Support" to "Management & Administration"
Now located under "Implementation Projects" for better workflow alignment
Improves logical grouping with related implementation tracking features

Bug Fixes
Fixed TypeScript errors related to companyInfo.industry → companyInfo.industries migration
Updated plant lookup API calls to use industries array joined with commas
Fixed completion summary to display all selected industries properly

Data Investigation
Investigated requirements count discrepancy in uploaded requirements
Original uploaded requirements appear to be missing from database
User will need to re-upload requirements via spreadsheet

Known Issues
CRITICAL BUG (UNRESOLVED): Date conversion error in business goals creation
"TypeError: value.toISOString is not a function" when saving goals with target dates
Needs investigation - appears to be date object serialization issue
